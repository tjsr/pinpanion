# PAX Pinny Companion

I'll come up with a non-trademark-infringing name 'soon'.

This project is an offline tool for managing and sharing your Pinny Arcade pin collections with friends.  The idea is that in environments where you can't get mobile reception (such as when there's 20,000 people all fighting for timeslots at PAX), you can run this offline or in airplane mode, and share lists you've created with others by having them scan a generated QR code which contains all the required data.

## Running the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Contact

This is a free app developed by Tim Rowe <tim@tjsr.id.au>.  It is designed to work in conjunction with pinnypals.com and pulls pin data from that as a source.

Want to make a donation?  Maybe just find me at PAX and donate a fodder pin.
